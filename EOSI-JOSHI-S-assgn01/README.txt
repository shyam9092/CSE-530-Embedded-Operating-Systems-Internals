steps to run part1 modules
--------------------------
Part 1 modules contains three files:
rbtraverse.c: linux driver file
main.c:       test code to test the driver
Makefile:     Makefile to compile the driver code and test code

Follow steps to compile
=> Go to directory "part1" and run the make command like below

$ make

=> this will create a kernel loadable module and test binary like below,

$ ls
main.c  Makefile  modules.order  Module.symvers  rbtraverse.c  rbtraverse.ko  rbtraverse.mod.c  rbtraverse.mod.o  rbtraverse.o  rbtraverse_tester

=> Connect intel galileo board to your host machine using FTDI and ethernet cable

=> Open terminal for intel galileo board and enter into root of intel galileo board

=> Copy the above mentioned files created by Makefile to intel galileo board

=> Run the following command to install module into kernel

$ insmod rbtraverse.ko

=> Run the following command to test the module 

$ ./rbtraverse_tester

=> The above command creats four pthreads for two drivers respectively. 
=> Each driver will populate the rbtree by writing 50 nodes of key and data
=> Also, after 50 writes each pthread will run read,ioctl in random order

This is a sample output log


steps to run part2 modules
--------------------------
rbprobe.c: linux driver file
main.c:    test code to test the probe driver
Makefile:  Makefile to compile the probe driver and test code

My part2 driver file has some functions to be completed as per asked by the assignment.
